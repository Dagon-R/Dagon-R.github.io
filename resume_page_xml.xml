			<description>
				Working within various Engines, there's a lot of things that you need to pick up to keep things moving forward.
				Keeping them straight is a lot easier than re-learning every time you swap projects!

			<title>Console Development</title>
			<subtitle></subtitle>
			<description>
				Console development adds just one more layer of complexity to everything else that needs to be considered when it comes to the development process.

			<description>
				Certainly the most Wizard-y game in recent memory; Hogwarts Legacy succeeded in bringing the Magical world to life in a way that other games can only dream of.
				I'm so tired of looking at robes.

			<title>H3VR Gun Game</title>
			<subtitle>Now with a statistically unlikely chance of giving you bad results!</subtitle>
			<description>
				H3VR is the single largest and best engineered Gun simulator in VR.
				Based on its extensive modding support, Gun Game brings the classic game mode from Call of Duty into H3.
				Originally developed by KacperObara, I developed several improvements that I had wanted included in the mod, which were then merged back in to main.

			<title>Food Wheel</title>
			<subtitle>All your Friends are Unhelpful</subtitle>
			<description>
				This is a really simple page that uses your location data to pull a list of local restaurants and select one at random.
				There is a bit of customization if you want to limit some options, but it's very rudimentary.
				Perfect when nobody will agree on anything, because it will easily prove that your group can agree on what everybody DOESN'T want.
